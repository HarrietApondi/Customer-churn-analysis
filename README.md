# Customer-churn-analysis - Python and SQL Project

Welcome.This project explores customer retention and churn in a bank using a simulated dataset. I used **SQL** and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** to answer key business questions and uncover patterns that drive customer churn.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Determine the overall churn rate
- Measure the average customer lifetime
- Identify inactive customers likely to churn
- Understand how churn varies by account type and over the years

---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- **Churn Rate:** Approximately **36.0%** of customers have closed their accounts.
- **Customer Lifetime:** The average customer stays with the bank for **35.41 months**.
- **Activity vs Retention:** Customers with frequent deposits and transactions are more likely to remain active.
- **Account Type Behavior:** Savings accounts showed slightly better retention than current accounts.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)
- **SQLite3** (for structured queries)
- **Google Colab** (interactive environment)
- **GitHub** (for sharing and version control)
